## Using Your Website

### Getting Started

**1. Start Chatting (No Login Required)**

Visit the homepage and you'll see a prominent chat interface. Click the input field and describe what you want to build. For example:

> "Build a SaaS landing page with pricing tiers, features section, and email signup"

The AI will ask clarifying questions to understand your requirements better. Answer naturally in the chat.

**2. Browse Templates**

Click "Browse Templates" on the homepage to see pre-built project types including SaaS Landing Pages, Dashboards, E-Commerce stores, Blogs, Portfolio sites, API Backends, Crypto Trackers, and Todo Apps. Click any template to see details about tech stack, complexity, and estimated generation time.

**3. Create Your Project**

Once you've described your project or selected a template, the system will prompt you to sign in. Click "Sign In" and authenticate through Manus OAuth. After signing in, you'll be redirected to create your project.

### Managing Projects

**View Your Dashboard**

Click "Dashboard" in the header to see all your projects. Each project card shows the project name, description, status (draft, generating, ready, deploying, deployed), and creation date. Click any project to open it.

**Project Detail View**

Inside a project, you'll find three tabs:

- **Chat Tab:** Continue conversations with the AI to refine your project. Ask for changes like "Add a dark mode toggle" or "Change the color scheme to blue."

- **Files Tab:** Browse all generated code files in a tree structure. Click any file to view its contents with syntax highlighting. Use the "Copy" button to copy code to your clipboard.

- **Deployments Tab:** View deployment history, trigger new deployments with "Deploy Now," and monitor real-time deployment logs. Click any deployment in the history to see detailed logs and status.

### Code Generation

When you generate code, the AI creates a complete project structure with 8-12 files including:
- `package.json` with dependencies
- Configuration files (`.gitignore`, `tsconfig.json`, etc.)
- Source code organized by feature
- `README.md` with setup instructions

All generated files are automatically committed to a GitHub repository in your connected organization.

### GitHub Integration

Every project automatically creates a GitHub repository with:
- Proper project structure and README
- All generated code files
- Descriptive commit messages
- `.gitignore` configured for your stack

Click "View on GitHub" in the project detail page to open the repository.

### Deploying Your Application

Navigate to the "Deployments" tab in your project and click "Deploy Now." The system will:

1. Create a deployment record (status: pending)
2. Build your project (status: building)
3. Deploy to production (status: deploying)
4. Complete with a live URL (status: success)

Monitor the deployment logs in real-time to see progress. If deployment fails, error messages will be displayed.
