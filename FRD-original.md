## System Overview

### Purpose and Scope

Project Catalyst is a web-based platform that provides end-to-end application development and deployment services through an AI-powered conversational interface. The system encompasses three primary functional domains: code generation, version control integration, and deployment orchestration. Users interact with the platform through a chat-first interface that accepts natural language project descriptions and produces deployable applications with complete source code, version control, and live hosting.

The platform is designed to handle the complete application lifecycle from initial concept to production deployment, including iterative refinement, environment management, database provisioning, and ongoing monitoring. The system architecture supports horizontal scaling to accommodate thousands of concurrent users and projects while maintaining sub-30-second response times for code generation and sub-5-minute deployment times.

### System Context

Project Catalyst operates as a standalone web application accessible via modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). The system integrates with multiple external services including OpenAI/Anthropic for AI code generation, GitHub for version control, cloud infrastructure providers for deployment hosting, and Stripe for payment processing. Users access the platform through a responsive web interface that adapts to desktop, tablet, and mobile form factors.

The platform maintains state across user sessions, preserving project history, conversation context, and deployment configurations. All user data is encrypted at rest and in transit, with role-based access control governing permissions for project management, deployment operations, and administrative functions.

### Key Stakeholders

**End Users:** Developers, founders, and technical professionals who create and deploy applications through the platform. Primary interaction occurs through the web interface for project creation, code review, and deployment management.

## Functional Requirements by Module

### Module 1: User Authentication and Authorization

#### FR-AUTH-001: User Registration and Login

**Description:** The system shall provide secure user authentication through Manus OAuth integration, allowing users to create accounts and access the platform using their Manus credentials.

**Functional Details:**

The authentication system implements OAuth 2.0 protocol with Manus as the identity provider. When users access the platform for the first time, they are presented with a "Sign In" button that redirects to the Manus OAuth portal. Upon successful authentication, the OAuth callback endpoint receives an authorization code, exchanges it for an access token, and creates or updates the user record in the platform database.

User sessions are managed through secure HTTP-only cookies with a 30-day expiration period. The session cookie contains a signed JWT token that includes the user's unique identifier, role, and session metadata. Each request to protected endpoints validates the session token and refreshes the user context.

The system supports automatic account creation on first login, populating user profiles with information provided by the OAuth provider including name, email, and profile picture. Users can sign out at any time, which invalidates the session cookie and requires re-authentication for subsequent access.

**Inputs:**
- OAuth authorization code from Manus identity provider
- User profile information (name, email, OAuth ID)
- Session management requests (login, logout, token refresh)

**Outputs:**
- Authenticated user session with secure cookie
- User profile data stored in database
- Session validation status for protected resources

**Business Rules:**
- All users must authenticate through Manus OAuth (no local password authentication)
- Session tokens expire after 30 days of inactivity
- Platform owner (identified by OWNER_OPEN_ID environment variable) automatically receives admin role
- New users default to "user" role with standard permissions
- Failed authentication attempts redirect to login page with error message

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- AC-AUTH-001-01: User can click "Sign In" and complete OAuth flow successfully
- AC-AUTH-001-02: Authenticated users receive session cookie valid for 30 days
- AC-AUTH-001-03: User profile is created/updated in database upon successful login
- AC-AUTH-001-04: Platform owner automatically assigned admin role on first login
- AC-AUTH-001-05: Users can sign out and session cookie is invalidated
- AC-AUTH-001-06: Unauthenticated users accessing protected routes redirect to login

#### FR-AUTH-002: Role-Based Access Control

**Description:** The system shall implement role-based access control (RBAC) with two primary roles: "user" and "admin", governing access to platform features and administrative functions.

**Functional Details:**

The RBAC system defines permissions at the API endpoint level, with middleware functions validating user roles before allowing access to protected resources. Standard users can create and manage their own projects, view their deployment history, and access subscription management features. Admin users inherit all standard user permissions plus additional capabilities for platform administration.

Admin-specific features include viewing all user accounts, accessing system-wide analytics, managing platform templates, moderating user-generated content in the template marketplace, and configuring platform-wide settings. The system enforces role checks at both the API layer (backend validation) and UI layer (conditional rendering of admin-only features).

Role assignment occurs automatically based on business rules (platform owner receives admin role) or manually through database updates. The system does not currently provide a UI for role management, requiring direct database access for role modifications beyond the automatic owner assignment.

**Inputs:**
- User authentication context (user ID, role)
- API endpoint access requests
- Administrative action requests

**Outputs:**
- Authorization decision (allow/deny access)
- Role-appropriate UI rendering
- Audit logs for administrative actions

**Business Rules:**
- Platform owner (OWNER_OPEN_ID) automatically assigned admin role
- All other users default to "user" role
- Admin role required for: user management, system analytics, template moderation, platform configuration
- Users can only access their own projects and data (data isolation)
- Role changes require database-level updates (no self-service role elevation)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- AC-AUTH-002-01: Admin users can access admin-only endpoints and UI features
- AC-AUTH-002-02: Standard users receive 403 Forbidden when accessing admin endpoints
- AC-AUTH-002-03: Platform owner automatically receives admin role on first login
- AC-AUTH-002-04: Users can only view and modify their own projects
- AC-AUTH-002-05: Admin UI elements hidden from standard users
- AC-AUTH-002-06: All administrative actions logged with user ID and timestamp

### Module 2: AI Code Generation

#### FR-GEN-001: Conversational Project Creation

**Description:** The system shall provide a chat-based interface where users describe their desired application in natural language, and the AI generates appropriate project specifications and code.

**Functional Details:**

The conversational interface implements a multi-turn dialogue system where users input project descriptions, requirements, and refinements through a text-based chat UI. The system maintains conversation context across multiple messages, allowing users to iteratively refine their requirements through follow-up questions and clarifications.

The AI conversation flow follows a structured pattern: initial project description → clarifying questions → technology stack selection → feature confirmation → code generation. The system uses GPT-4 Turbo or Claude 3.5 Sonnet as the primary language model, with prompts engineered to extract structured project requirements from natural language input.

Conversation state is persisted in the database, associating each message with a project ID, user ID, timestamp, and role (user/assistant/system). This enables conversation history review, context preservation across sessions, and potential conversation replay for debugging or training purposes.

The system implements intelligent prompt engineering that guides users toward providing complete project specifications. When users provide vague descriptions, the AI asks targeted questions about framework preferences, styling requirements, database needs, authentication requirements, and deployment targets.

**Inputs:**
- User text messages describing project requirements
- Conversation history and context
- Project metadata (name, description, technology preferences)
- Template selection (if user chooses pre-built template)

**Outputs:**
- AI-generated clarifying questions
- Structured project specification
- Technology stack recommendations
- Feature list and implementation plan
- Conversation history stored in database

**Business Rules:**
- Free tier users limited to 10 AI generation requests per project
- Paid tier users have unlimited generation requests
- Conversation context limited to last 20 messages for token efficiency
- System prompts include best practices, security guidelines, and code quality standards
- AI responses must be deterministic for given inputs (temperature=0.3)
- Generation requests timeout after 60 seconds

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- AC-GEN-001-01: Users can send text messages describing their project
- AC-GEN-001-02: AI responds with relevant clarifying questions
- AC-GEN-001-03: Conversation history persisted and retrievable
- AC-GEN-001-04: AI extracts structured requirements from natural language
- AC-GEN-001-05: System handles multi-turn conversations maintaining context
- AC-GEN-001-06: Generation requests complete within 60 seconds or timeout gracefully

#### FR-GEN-002: Code Generation and File Structure

**Description:** The system shall generate complete, production-ready source code with proper file structure, dependencies, and configuration based on project requirements.

**Functional Details:**

The code generation engine produces a complete application codebase including frontend files, backend API endpoints, database schemas, configuration files, and deployment manifests. The system supports multiple technology stacks including Next.js, React, Vue, Node.js, Express, Python Flask/FastAPI, and various database systems.

Generated code follows industry best practices including modular architecture, separation of concerns, environment-based configuration, error handling, input validation, and security hardening. The system includes boilerplate code for common patterns such as authentication, API routing, database connections, and frontend state management.

File structure generation creates a logical directory hierarchy appropriate for the chosen technology stack. For example, a Next.js project includes `pages/`, `components/`, `lib/`, `public/`, and `styles/` directories with appropriate files in each. Backend projects include separate directories for routes, controllers, models, middleware, and utilities.

The generation process produces a structured output containing file paths, file contents, and metadata (file type, language, purpose). This structured format enables the system to display file previews, create GitHub repositories with proper directory structures, and build deployment containers with correct file placement.

**Inputs:**
- Structured project requirements from conversation
- Technology stack selection (framework, database, styling)
- Feature list and functional requirements
- Template selection (if applicable)
- User preferences (TypeScript vs JavaScript, styling approach)

**Outputs:**
- Complete source code for all application files
- Package.json or equivalent dependency manifest
- Environment variable template (.env.example)
- README.md with setup instructions
- Configuration files (tsconfig.json, tailwind.config.js, etc.)
- Database migration files or schema definitions

**Business Rules:**
- Generated code must compile/run without errors
- All dependencies must specify version numbers (no wildcards)
- Environment variables must use descriptive names with examples
- README must include setup, development, and deployment instructions
- Code must include comments explaining complex logic
- Generated files must not exceed 10,000 lines per file
- Total project size must not exceed 50MB

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- AC-GEN-002-01: System generates complete file structure for chosen stack
- AC-GEN-002-02: Generated code compiles and runs without errors

- AC-GEN-002-07: Generated project size under 50MB

#### FR-GEN-003: Template System

**Description:** The system shall provide pre-built project templates for common use cases, allowing users to quick-start projects with proven architectures.

**Functional Details:**

The template system maintains a library of pre-configured project templates covering common application types such as SaaS landing pages, todo applications, e-commerce stores, dashboards, blogs, and API services. Each template includes complete source code, database schemas, authentication setup, and deployment configuration.

Templates are stored in the database with metadata including name, description, category, technology stack, preview image, and usage count. Users can browse templates by category, search by keywords, and preview template features before selection. Selecting a template pre-populates the project with the template's code, which users can then customize through conversational refinement.

The system supports both platform-provided templates (curated by administrators) and user-contributed templates (future marketplace feature). Platform templates are marked as "official" and receive priority placement in the template browser. User templates undergo moderation before public availability.

Template customization occurs through the same conversational interface as new project creation. Users can request modifications such as "change the color scheme to blue" or "add email notifications," and the AI updates the template code accordingly while preserving the template's core structure.

**Inputs:**
- Template selection by user
- Template metadata (name, category, stack)
- Customization requests via conversation
- Template search queries

**Outputs:**
- List of available templates with previews
- Complete template code loaded into project
- Customized template code based on user requests

- Paid tier users can create and save custom templates
- Templates must be production-ready and fully functional
- Template code must follow same quality standards as generated code
- User templates require admin approval before public listing
- Template preview images must be 1200x630px (Open Graph format)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- AC-GEN-003-01: Users can browse templates by category
- AC-GEN-003-02: Template selection loads complete code into project
- AC-GEN-003-03: Users can customize templates through conversation

### Module 3: GitHub Integration

#### FR-GIT-001: Repository Creation and Management

**Description:** The system shall automatically create GitHub repositories for user projects and manage repository operations including commits, branches, and access control.

**Functional Details:**

The GitHub integration module uses the GitHub API to programmatically create repositories in user-specified organizations or personal accounts. When a user completes project generation, the system creates a new GitHub repository with the project name, adds a descriptive README, and pushes the initial codebase.

Repository creation requires users to provide a GitHub Personal Access Token with appropriate permissions (repo scope for private repositories, public_repo for public repositories). The token is stored securely in encrypted environment variables and used for all GitHub API operations on behalf of the user.

The system initializes repositories with a main branch containing the generated code, a .gitignore file appropriate for the technology stack, and a comprehensive README.md explaining the project structure and setup instructions. The initial commit message follows conventional commit format: "feat: initial project setup with [framework] and [features]".

Repository management features include creating new branches for feature development, managing pull requests (future feature), and configuring repository settings such as visibility (public/private), description, and topics. The system maintains a mapping between platform projects and GitHub repositories, storing the repository URL and metadata in the project database record.

**Inputs:**
- GitHub Personal Access Token (user-provided)
- Repository name and description
- Organization name (if creating in organization)
- Repository visibility preference (public/private)
- Generated project code and file structure

**Outputs:**
- Created GitHub repository with initial code
- Repository URL stored in project record
- Initial commit with all project files
- .gitignore and README.md files
- Repository configuration (description, topics, visibility)

**Business Rules:**
- Users must provide valid GitHub token with repo permissions
- Repository names must be unique within user's GitHub account/organization
- Repository names must follow GitHub naming conventions (alphanumeric, hyphens, underscores)
- Free tier users limited to public repositories only
- Paid tier users can create private repositories
- System does not delete repositories (users must delete manually on GitHub)
- Repository creation failures must be retried up to 3 times

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- AC-GIT-001-01: System creates GitHub repository with user-provided name

- AC-GIT-001-05: .gitignore appropriate for technology stack
- AC-GIT-001-06: Repository creation errors handled gracefully with user feedback
- AC-GIT-001-07: Users can specify public/private visibility

#### FR-GIT-002: Automatic Commits on Code Changes

**Description:** The system shall automatically commit code changes to GitHub when users modify projects through the conversational interface.

**Functional Details:**

The automatic commit system monitors project modifications and creates GitHub commits whenever users request code changes through the AI interface. When a user asks for modifications like "change the button color to blue" or "add a new API endpoint," the system generates the updated code, applies the changes to the local project state, and commits the changes to the GitHub repository.

Each automatic commit includes a descriptive commit message generated by the AI that explains what changed and why. Commit messages follow conventional commit format with type prefixes (feat, fix, style, refactor, docs) and concise descriptions. For example: "feat: add user profile page with avatar upload" or "fix: resolve authentication redirect loop".

The system maintains a commit history in the project database, recording commit SHAs, timestamps, messages, and associated conversation messages. This enables users to review the evolution of their project and potentially roll back to previous versions (future feature).

Automatic commits are pushed to the main branch by default. Advanced users (paid tiers) can configure branch strategies, creating feature branches for experimental changes and merging to main only after confirmation. The system supports both immediate commits (default) and batched commits (user configurable).

**Inputs:**
- Code modifications from AI generation
- Conversation context explaining changes
- User preferences for commit behavior
- Current repository state and commit history

**Outputs:**
- Git commit with modified files
- Commit pushed to GitHub repository
- Commit SHA and metadata stored in database
- Commit message generated from conversation context
- Updated repository state reflected in UI

**Business Rules:**
- Commits only created when code actually changes (no empty commits)
- Commit messages must be descriptive and follow conventional format
- Commits pushed immediately unless user configures batching
- Failed pushes retried up to 3 times before alerting user
- Commit history preserved indefinitely (no automatic cleanup)
- Users can view commit history in project timeline
- Maximum 100 commits per project per day (rate limiting)

**Acceptance Criteria:**

### Module 4: Deployment System

#### FR-DEP-001: Containerized Application Deployment

**Description:** The system shall deploy user applications to cloud infrastructure using containerization technology, providing live URLs for accessing deployed applications.

**Functional Details:**

The deployment system builds Docker containers from generated project code and deploys them to a Kubernetes cluster hosted on cloud infrastructure (AWS EKS, Google GKE, or Azure AKS). The deployment process includes building the container image, pushing to a container registry, creating Kubernetes deployment manifests, and exposing the application through an ingress controller.

Container builds use Nixpacks, an open-source build system that automatically detects the technology stack and creates optimized Docker images without requiring users to write Dockerfiles. Nixpacks supports Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, Rust, PHP, and static site generators, automatically installing dependencies and configuring runtime environments.

Each deployment receives a unique subdomain in the format `[project-id].catalyst.app` (or custom domain if configured). The system configures automatic HTTPS using Let's Encrypt certificates, ensuring all deployed applications are accessible over secure connections. DNS records are automatically created and updated when deployments occur.

The deployment process follows these steps: (1) Fetch code from GitHub repository, (2) Build container image using Nixpacks, (3) Push image to container registry, (4) Create/update Kubernetes deployment, (5) Configure service and ingress, (6) Wait for deployment to become ready, (7) Update project record with deployment URL and status.

Deployments are configured with resource limits appropriate for the user's subscription tier. Free tier deployments receive 512MB RAM and 0.5 CPU cores. Pro tier receives 1GB RAM and 1 CPU core. Scale tier receives 2GB RAM and 2 CPU cores. The system monitors resource usage and alerts users when approaching limits.

**Inputs:**
- GitHub repository URL with project code
- Technology stack and build configuration
- Environment variables for runtime configuration
- Resource allocation based on subscription tier
- Custom domain configuration (if applicable)

**Outputs:**
- Docker container image stored in registry
- Kubernetes deployment running application
- Live URL for accessing deployed application
- SSL certificate for HTTPS access
- Deployment status and logs
- Resource usage metrics

**Business Rules:**
- Free tier limited to 3 active deployments
- Pro tier allows 25 active deployments
- Scale tier allows 100 active deployments
- Deployments automatically restart on failure (up to 3 attempts)
- Inactive deployments (no traffic for 30 days) automatically paused
- Deployment builds timeout after 10 minutes
- Container images cached for 7 days for faster rebuilds
- Failed deployments retain logs for 24 hours

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- AC-DEP-001-01: System builds Docker container from project code

- AC-DEP-001-07: Deployments automatically restart on crash
- AC-DEP-001-08: Build process completes within 10 minutes or times out

#### FR-DEP-002: Environment Variable Management

**Description:** The system shall provide secure management of environment variables for deployed applications, allowing users to configure runtime settings without modifying code.

**Functional Details:**

The environment variable management system provides a UI for users to add, edit, and delete environment variables that are injected into their deployed applications at runtime. Variables are stored encrypted in the database and securely passed to containers during deployment.

Users access environment variable management through the project settings page, where they can add new variables by specifying a key-value pair. The system validates variable names to ensure they follow standard naming conventions (uppercase letters, numbers, underscores). Sensitive values (marked as "secret") are masked in the UI and encrypted at rest.

When deployments occur, the system retrieves environment variables from the database, decrypts them, and injects them into the Kubernetes deployment as a ConfigMap (for non-sensitive values) or Secret (for sensitive values). The application code accesses these variables through standard environment variable APIs (process.env in Node.js, os.environ in Python, etc.).

The system provides common environment variable templates for popular services (database connection strings, API keys, OAuth credentials). Users can select a template and fill in the values, reducing configuration errors. The system also validates certain variable formats (URLs, email addresses, numeric values) to catch errors before deployment.

Changes to environment variables trigger automatic redeployment to apply the new configuration. Users can preview changes before applying them and roll back to previous configurations if needed. The system maintains a history of environment variable changes with timestamps and user IDs for audit purposes.

**Inputs:**
- Environment variable key-value pairs
- Variable sensitivity flag (secret/non-secret)
- Variable validation rules and formats
- Template selection for common services

**Outputs:**
- Encrypted environment variables stored in database
- ConfigMaps and Secrets created in Kubernetes
- Variables injected into application runtime
- Variable change history and audit log

- Variable values limited to 10KB each
- Changes to variables trigger automatic redeployment
- Variable history retained for 90 days
- System-managed variables (PORT, NODE_ENV) cannot be modified
- Free tier users limited to 20 environment variables

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- AC-DEP-002-01: Users can add environment variables through UI
- AC-DEP-002-02: Secret variables masked in UI and encrypted at rest
- AC-DEP-002-03: Variables injected into deployed application correctly

#### FR-DEP-003: Deployment Logs and Monitoring

**Description:** The system shall provide real-time deployment logs and application monitoring, enabling users to troubleshoot issues and monitor application health.

**Functional Details:**

The logging and monitoring system captures output from the build process, deployment operations, and running applications, making logs accessible through the platform UI. Logs are streamed in real-time during deployments and stored for historical review.

Build logs include output from dependency installation, compilation, and container image creation. Deployment logs show Kubernetes operations including pod creation, service configuration, and ingress setup. Application logs capture stdout and stderr from the running application, including request logs, error messages, and custom logging output.

The UI provides a log viewer with syntax highlighting, search functionality, and filtering by log level (info, warning, error). Users can view live logs that update in real-time or historical logs from previous deployments. Log retention follows subscription tier limits: free tier retains 24 hours, Pro tier retains 7 days, Scale tier retains 30 days.

Monitoring features include basic metrics such as request count, response times, error rates, memory usage, and CPU utilization. Metrics are displayed in time-series charts with configurable time ranges (1 hour, 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days). The system alerts users when metrics exceed thresholds (error rate >5%, memory usage >90%, CPU usage >80%).

The system integrates with application performance monitoring (APM) tools through standard instrumentation libraries. Users can optionally connect external monitoring services (Datadog, New Relic, Sentry) by providing API keys in environment variables.

**Inputs:**
- Build process output and errors
- Kubernetes deployment events
- Application stdout/stderr streams
- Resource usage metrics from containers
- External APM service credentials (optional)

**Outputs:**

### Module 5: Database Management

#### FR-DB-001: Database Provisioning

**Description:** The system shall provision managed database instances for user applications, supporting PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, and Redis with automatic configuration and connection management.

**Functional Details:**

The database provisioning system creates managed database instances on cloud infrastructure, configuring them for optimal performance and security. Users select their desired database type and tier through the project settings UI, and the system handles all provisioning, configuration, and connection setup.

Database provisioning follows these steps: (1) User selects database type and tier, (2) System creates database instance on cloud provider, (3) Database credentials generated and stored securely, (4) Connection string added to project environment variables, (5) Database initialized with schema if provided, (6) Backup schedule configured, (7) Monitoring enabled.

Each database instance is isolated per project with dedicated resources based on subscription tier. Free tier receives shared database instances with 1GB storage. Pro tier receives dedicated instances with 10GB storage and 1 CPU core. Scale tier receives high-performance instances with 50GB storage and 2 CPU cores. Storage automatically scales up to tier limits when approaching capacity.

The system supports multiple database types with appropriate defaults: PostgreSQL 15 for relational data, MySQL 8.0 for compatibility with legacy systems, MongoDB 6.0 for document storage, and Redis 7.0 for caching and session management. Users can provision multiple databases per project (e.g., PostgreSQL for primary data + Redis for caching).

Database connection strings are automatically injected into application environment variables using standard naming conventions (DATABASE_URL for primary database, REDIS_URL for Redis, etc.). The system configures connection pooling, SSL encryption, and authentication automatically, requiring no manual configuration from users.

**Inputs:**
- Database type selection (PostgreSQL/MySQL/MongoDB/Redis)
- Database tier and resource allocation
- Initial schema or migration scripts (optional)
- Backup retention preferences
- Database name and description

**Outputs:**

### Module 6: User Dashboard and Project Management

#### FR-DASH-001: Project Dashboard

**Description:** The system shall provide a centralized dashboard where users can view all their projects, monitor deployment status, and access project management functions.

**Functional Details:**

The project dashboard serves as the primary landing page for authenticated users, displaying a grid or list view of all projects owned by the user. Each project card shows key information including project name, description, technology stack, deployment status, last updated timestamp, and quick action buttons.

Project cards use visual indicators to communicate status: green badge for "deployed" projects with live URLs, yellow badge for "building" projects currently deploying, red badge for "failed" deployments with error indicators, and gray badge for "draft" projects not yet deployed. Users can click on any project card to navigate to the detailed project view.

The dashboard includes filtering and sorting capabilities, allowing users to filter by status (all/deployed/building/failed/draft), technology stack (Next.js/React/Python/etc.), or creation date. Sorting options include newest first, oldest first, recently updated, and alphabetical by name. A search bar enables finding projects by name or description.

Quick actions available from the dashboard include: create new project, view project details, open deployed application, view deployment logs, delete project, and duplicate project. The duplicate function creates a copy of an existing project with all code and configuration, enabling users to quickly create variations or test changes.

The dashboard displays usage statistics for the current billing period, including projects created, deployments executed, AI generation requests used, and storage consumed. Progress bars show usage relative to subscription tier limits, with warnings when approaching limits (>80% usage).

**Inputs:**
- User authentication context
- Project query filters and sorting preferences
- Search queries
- Quick action requests (create/delete/duplicate)

**Outputs:**
- Paginated list of user projects with metadata
- Visual status indicators for each project
- Usage statistics and tier limit warnings
- Quick action execution results
- Navigation to detailed project views

**Business Rules:**
- Dashboard displays only projects owned by authenticated user
- Projects sorted by last updated timestamp by default
- Pagination at 20 projects per page
- Deleted projects moved to trash (soft delete) for 30 days
- Duplicate projects inherit all settings except deployment URLs
- Usage statistics updated every 5 minutes
- Dashboard loads within 2 seconds for up to 100 projects

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- AC-DASH-001-01: Dashboard displays all user projects with correct metadata
- AC-DASH-001-02: Status badges accurately reflect deployment state
- AC-DASH-001-03: Filtering and sorting work correctly
- AC-DASH-001-04: Search returns relevant projects
- AC-DASH-001-05: Quick actions execute successfully
- AC-DASH-001-06: Usage statistics display current billing period data
- AC-DASH-001-07: Dashboard loads within 2 seconds
- AC-DASH-001-08: Pagination works for users with >20 projects

## Security Requirements

### Authentication Security

**REQ-SEC-001:** All user authentication must occur through Manus OAuth 2.0 protocol with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) to prevent authorization code interception attacks.

**REQ-SEC-002:** Session tokens must be stored in HTTP-only, Secure, SameSite=Strict cookies to prevent XSS and CSRF attacks.

### Data Flow: Repository Import and Modification

```
1. User enters GitHub URL
   ↓
2. Frontend validates URL format
   ↓
3. Backend fetches repo info from GitHub API
   ↓
4. Backend fetches file tree (up to 100 files)
   ↓
5. Backend fetches content for each file
   ↓
6. Backend creates project record (isImported=true)
   ↓
7. Backend saves files to database
   ↓
8. Frontend displays success and redirects
   ↓
9. User requests codebase analysis
   ↓
10. Backend sends files to LLM for analysis
    ↓
11. LLM returns structured analysis
    ↓
12. Frontend displays analysis with components
    ↓
13. User requests code modification
    ↓
14. Backend analyzes codebase for context
    ↓
15. Backend sends modification request to LLM
    ↓
16. LLM generates code changes
    ↓
17. Frontend displays diff preview
    ↓
18. User approves changes
    ↓
19. Backend creates new branch
    ↓
20. Backend commits changes to branch
    ↓
21. Backend creates pull request
    ↓
22. Frontend displays PR URL

## Updated Security Requirements

### Additional Security Considerations (Version 2.0)

**SEC-7.1: GitHub Token Security**
- GitHub personal access tokens SHALL be stored encrypted
- Tokens SHALL have minimum required scopes (repo, read:user)
- Tokens SHALL be rotated every 90 days
- System SHALL never log or display tokens in plain text

**SEC-7.2: Repository Access Control**
- Users SHALL only import repositories they have access to
- System SHALL verify repository permissions before import
- Private repository imports SHALL require authentication
- System SHALL respect GitHub's rate limits and terms of service

**SEC-7.3: Code Modification Safety**
- All modifications SHALL go through pull request workflow
- System SHALL never commit directly to main/master branch
- Users SHALL review all changes before merging
- System SHALL provide rollback capability via PR closure

**SEC-7.4: LLM Input Sanitization**
- User input SHALL be sanitized before sending to LLM
- System SHALL prevent prompt injection attacks
- System SHALL limit LLM context window to prevent data leakage
- System SHALL not send sensitive data (API keys, passwords) to LLM
