# Business Requirements Document (BRD)
## Project Catalyst - AI Development & Deployment Platform

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 30, 2025  
**Author:** Manus AI  
**Project Status:** MVP Phase - Active Development

---

## Executive Summary

Project Catalyst is a unified AI-powered development and deployment platform designed to democratize software development by combining intelligent code generation with seamless production deployment. The platform enables users to transform natural language descriptions into production-ready applications and deploy them to live environments within minutes, eliminating the traditional barriers between ideation and execution.

The platform addresses a critical market gap by integrating three traditionally separate workflows—code generation, version control, and deployment—into a single, cohesive experience. This integration reduces the time from concept to production from weeks or months to mere minutes, while maintaining professional code quality and deployment reliability.

**Target Market:** Solo developers, indie hackers, startup founders, and small development teams who need to rapidly prototype, iterate, and deploy web applications without extensive DevOps knowledge or infrastructure management overhead.

**Core Value Proposition:** "From Idea to Production in Minutes" - A complete end-to-end solution that handles the entire software development lifecycle through conversational AI interaction.

The **Free tier** serves as an effective acquisition channel, allowing users to experience the platform's value before committing financially. The generous limits (3 projects, 10 generations each) provide enough functionality to build and deploy real applications, creating strong conversion incentives.

The **Scale tier at $150/month** targets professional users who need higher resource limits and team features, positioned below enterprise solutions but above individual tools. This tier is designed to capture agencies and consultants who bill clients for development work and can easily justify the cost through time savings.

**Enterprise pricing** is intentionally flexible to accommodate diverse organizational needs and budgets, with custom contracts allowing for volume discounts and specialized requirements.

Project Catalyst now includes its own deployment infrastructure, eliminating dependency on external providers (Vercel, Railway, Kubernetes). Users can deploy applications directly to Project Catalyst's infrastructure with zero configuration.

**Business Value:**
- **Revenue Independence**: No revenue sharing with external deployment providers
- **User Lock-in**: Users deploy on our infrastructure, increasing platform stickiness
- **Competitive Differentiation**: True "Manus Lite" - complete end-to-end solution
- **Cost Control**: Predictable infrastructure costs vs. per-deployment provider fees
- **Faster Time-to-Market**: No external account setup or API key management required

**Key Capabilities:**
1. **One-Click Deployment** - Deploy any project with single button click
2. **Automatic Buildpack Detection** - Nixpacks automatically detects Node.js, Python, Go, static sites
3. **Subdomain Generation** - Free `yourapp.catalyst.app` subdomain for every deployment
4. **Real-time Monitoring** - Live deployment status, health checks, and logs
5. **Resource Management** - CPU (1 core), memory (512MB), storage (1GB) limits per deployment
6. **Container Orchestration** - Docker-based isolation and management
7. **Instant Control** - Start, stop, restart deployments anytime

**Updated Competitive Position:**

| Feature | Project Catalyst | Vercel | Railway | Replit |
|---------|-----------------|---------|---------|--------|
| AI Code Generation | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Import Existing Repos | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| AI Code Modification | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Built-in Deployment | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| External Provider Support | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| GitHub Integration | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Price** | **$29/mo** | $20/mo | $5/mo | $7/mo |

**Updated Revenue Model:**

**Deployment Tiers:**
- **Starter (Included in $29/mo)**: 3 active deployments, 1 CPU core, 512MB RAM each
- **Pro ($49/mo)**: 10 active deployments, 2 CPU cores, 1GB RAM each, custom domains
- **Team ($99/mo)**: 50 active deployments, 4 CPU cores, 2GB RAM each, SSL certificates, priority support

**Projected Impact:**
- **30% conversion** from Starter to Pro tier for users with multiple projects
- **Additional $20-70/mo** average revenue per upgraded user
- **Reduced churn** from 15% to 8% due to deployment lock-in

**Updated Financial Projections (Year 1):**

| Month | Users | Starter ($29) | Pro ($49) | Team ($99) | MRR | ARR |
|-------|-------|---------------|-----------|------------|-----|-----|
| 1-3 | 50 | 50 | 0 | 0 | $1,450 | $17,400 |
| 4-6 | 200 | 160 | 35 | 5 | $7,960 | $95,520 |
| 7-9 | 500 | 350 | 120 | 30 | $19,030 | $228,360 |
| 10-12 | 1000 | 650 | 280 | 70 | $39,570 | $474,840 |

**Risk Mitigation:**
- **Infrastructure Costs**: Monitor per-user deployment costs, implement fair use policy
- **Scalability**: Start with Docker, plan migration to Kubernetes for scale
- **Reliability**: Implement health checks, automatic restarts, and deployment rollbacks
- **Security**: Container isolation, resource limits, and network policies
