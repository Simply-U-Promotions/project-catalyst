# Business Requirements Document (BRD)
## Project Catalyst - AI-Powered Development Platform

**Document Version:** 2.1  
**Date:** October 30, 2025  
**Prepared By:** Project Catalyst Team  
**Status:** Active Development

---

## Executive Summary

Project Catalyst is an AI-powered development platform that enables developers to generate production-ready code, import and modify existing repositories, and deploy applications—all within a single integrated environment. By combining code generation, GitHub integration, AI-assisted code modification, and built-in deployment infrastructure, Project Catalyst delivers a complete "idea-to-production" workflow that reduces development time by 70% and eliminates the need for multiple tools and platforms.

**Key Differentiators:**
- **Brownfield Support**: Import and modify existing repositories with AI assistance
- **Built-in Deployment**: Host applications directly without external providers
- **Security-First**: Prompt injection protection, cost monitoring, and admin controls
- **PR-Based Workflow**: Never commits to main—all changes via pull requests

---

3. **Achieve Product-Market Fit**: Validate with 1,000 paying users by Q4 2026
4. **Build Sustainable Revenue**: Reach $40K MRR within 12 months of launch

### Success Metrics
- **User Acquisition**: 1,000 paid subscribers within Year 1
- **Retention Rate**: >85% monthly retention (vs. industry average 70%)
- **Revenue Growth**: $474K ARR by end of Year 1
- **AI Quality**: >85% user satisfaction with code modifications
- **Deployment Success**: >95% successful deployments

## Infrastructure Architecture Strategy

### Backend Architecture Decision (Critical)

**Recommendation from Technical Review:**
The platform should NOT run its own backend on Kubernetes. Managing K8s for both the platform backend AND user deployments creates 10x operational burden.

**Adopted Strategy:**

#### Platform Backend (Project Catalyst Application)
- **Hosting**: Serverless (AWS Fargate / Google Cloud Run)
- **Rationale**: 
  - Zero operational overhead
  - Auto-scaling without configuration
  - Pay only for actual usage
  - Focus engineering time on AI/DevEx, not DevOps
- **Components**:
  - API Layer (tRPC + Express)
  - Database (Managed MySQL/TiDB)
  - LLM Integration
  - GitHub API Integration

#### User Application Deployments
- **Hosting**: Docker containers (MVP), Kubernetes (future scale)
- **Rationale**:
  - Full control over user application lifecycle
  - Resource isolation and security
  - Flexible scaling per deployment
  - Industry-standard approach (like Railway, Render)
- **Components**:
  - Docker Engine
  - Nixpacks (buildpack detection)
  - Traefik (reverse proxy)
  - Container orchestration

**Key Insight**: Separate concerns—use managed services for our backend, use containers for user apps. This prevents the "10x DevOps workload" trap identified in the review.

### Infrastructure Cost Model

**Platform Backend Costs (Serverless):**
- **Compute**: $0.00001667/GB-second (Fargate)
- **Estimated Monthly**: $500-1,000 for 1,000 users
- **Scaling**: Automatic, no manual intervention

**User Deployment Costs (Docker/K8s):**
- **Compute**: $0.04/hour per container (1 core, 512MB)
- **Storage**: $0.10/GB/month
- **Bandwidth**: $0.09/GB
- **Estimated per User**: $5-8/month (3 deployments average)
- **Total at 1,000 users**: $5,000-8,000/month

**Total Infrastructure**: $5,500-9,000/month (included in financial projections)

### Scalability Roadmap

**Phase 1 (Months 1-6): Docker + Serverless**
- Platform backend on AWS Fargate
- User deployments on Docker Engine
- Single-region (US-East)
- Target: 0-500 users

**Phase 2 (Months 7-12): Docker + Multi-Region**
- Add EU and Asia regions
- Geo-routing for deployments
- CDN integration
- Target: 500-2,000 users

**Phase 3 (Year 2): Kubernetes Migration**
- Migrate user deployments to K8s
- Horizontal pod autoscaling
- Multi-tenant clusters
- Target: 2,000-10,000 users

## Risk Analysis

### Technical Risks

**R-AI-01: AI Quality Issues**
- **Risk**: Generated code doesn't work or breaks existing functionality
- **Mitigation**: Repo Gauntlet testing, "Report AI Error" button, continuous prompt improvement
- **Status**: Partially mitigated (testing framework in place)

**R-AI-02: LLM Cost Overruns**
- **Risk**: Power users generate excessive API costs
- **Mitigation**: Admin cost dashboard, rate limiting (10/hour), fair use policy
- **Status**: Mitigated (monitoring in place)

**R-SEC-01: Prompt Injection Attacks**
- **Risk**: Users manipulate AI to generate malicious code
- **Mitigation**: 30+ jailbreak pattern detection, security event logging, admin kill switches
- **Status**: Mitigated (security layer implemented)

**R-INFRA-01: Deployment Infrastructure Scaling**
- **Risk**: Docker-based system can't scale to 1,000+ concurrent deployments
- **Mitigation**: Start with Docker, plan Kubernetes migration for Q2 2026
- **Status**: Accepted (MVP approach)

**R-INFRA-02: Infrastructure Costs**
- **Risk**: Deployment hosting costs exceed revenue
- **Mitigation**: Resource limits, fair use policy, cost monitoring per user
- **Status**: Monitoring required

### Business Risks

**R-BIZ-01: Competitive Pressure**
- **Risk**: Cursor, Replit, or v0.dev add brownfield support
- **Mitigation**: PR-based workflow differentiation, deployment flexibility, faster iteration
- **Status**: Accepted (compete on execution)

**R-BIZ-02: User Acquisition Cost**
- **Risk**: CAC exceeds LTV
- **Mitigation**: Content marketing, developer community, product-led growth
- **Status**: Monitoring required
